          Average cost to improve the energy efficiency of each dwelling
          category. For each local authority, this was calculated using the
          recommended energy efficiency measures displayed on EPCs and
          considering their indicative costs. In this study, an ensemble
          approach was used where the predictions from different sub-models were
          combined to improve the accuracy of the final predictions. Figure 6
          shows an example of this approach with two sub-models: a Main model
          and an additional model, Model 99. These sub-models were used to
          predict the values of a target variable, either heat production or
          energy demand. The Main model was trained on the entire dataset.
          Meanwhile, Model 99 was trained on a subset of the dataset that only
          included the target variable values above the 99th percentile, other
          values were set to zero. When the predictions from the Main model were
          lower than the predictions from Model 99, they were replaced by the
          predictions from Model 99. This was done to improve the predicted peak
          heat production and peak energy demand. The results are referred to as
          combined predictions.
